# LowCostMalariaDetection-CVPR-2022
In this project we tried to make malaria detection easily possible at low cost. We present M5 Dataset which is the first ever dataset that is across microscopes and across magnifications.
## Dataset Details
M5 Dataset (Multi Micrscope Multi Magnification Malaria Dataset) contains 2x 3x 1257 Images containing malarial blood cells.
